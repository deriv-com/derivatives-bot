In the third trade, the stake adjusts to 2 units due to a lower probability of a successful trade. If the third trade is also successful, the strategy then allocates all the previous gains (a total of 6 units of initial stake) into the fourth trade with the aim of doubling the potential profits. If the fourth trade results in a positive outcome, the strategy helps achieve a total gain of 12 units.
